## Get a little teoria before ?!
AtomicRact was designed in atoms concept. What things in the universe are made of?
Let's get an essencial thing to our lives: The Water. The water is made with a lot of molecules whose each one is composed by one oxigen and two hidrogen atoms.
Basically Atom Concept is create things from the minimal particle of them.

## How it works
In AtomicReact the minimal particle is called by Atom. One Atom is formed by 3 parts: Structure (HTML) & Logic (JS) & Style (CSS). Necessarily, an Atom need to have a structure but doesn't need a logic and style.
After runs `Atomic` command,  is created your `AtomicDir` where your Atoms will be.
In `AtomicDir` there are three dirs: html, js, css.
``` text
└── AtomicDir
    ├── html
    ├── js
    └── css
```
**To create an Atom**, just create one file with anyone name in `AtomicDir/html` folder.
