## [Let's Get Started](https://atomicreact.github.io/AtomicReact/#/getStarted)

## Requirements
1. [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org) (with NPM of course)

## Get a little teoria before ?!
AtomicReact was designed in atoms concept. What things in the universe are made of?
Let's get an essencial thing to our lives: The Water. The water is made with a lot of molecules whose each one is composed by one oxigen and two hidrogen atoms.
Basically Atom Concept is create things from the minimal particle of them.

## How it works
In AtomicReact the minimal particle is called by Atom. One Atom is formed by 3 parts: Structure (HTML) & Logic (JS) & Style (CSS). Necessarily, an Atom need to have a structure but doesn't need a logic and style.
